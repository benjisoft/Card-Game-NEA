# Card Game API

This was a project that was set to me during college. Instead of doing the usual and creating a simple script like most people would, I decided to spend 5 minutes doing exactly that and then the rest of the time setting up a Natural Language Processing API with AWS to decide whether the player wanted to continue playing or quit. Is it overkill? Yes. Is it cool? Also yes.
